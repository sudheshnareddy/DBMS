1. For the ERD in Figure 1, you should indicate the applications of the entity type rule. For each entity type rule application, you should identify the table name, primary key, and other columns. You do not need to write CREATE TABLE statements.

Student(StdNo, StdName, StdAddress, StdCity, StdState, StdZip, StdEmail)

Table Name: Student
Primary Key: StdNo
Columns: Attributes listed

Loan(LoanNo, ProcDate, DisbMethod, DisbBank, DateAuth, NoteValue, Subsidized, Rate)

Table Name: Loan
Primary Key: LoanNo
Columns: Attributes listed

Institution(InstID, InstName, InstMascot)

Table Name: Institution
Primary Key: InstID
Columns: Attributes listed

Lender(LenderNo, LendName)

Table Name: Lender
Primary Key: LenderNo
Columns: Attributes listed


2. For the ERD in Figure 1, you should indicate applications of the 1-M relationship rule. For each 1-M relationship rule application, you should indicate the changes to the tables you listed in problem 1 including foreign key columns and NOT NULL constraints for foreign keys if necessary.

Loan(LoanNo, StdNo, LenderNo, InstID, ProcDate, DisbMethod, DisbBank, DateAuth, NoteValue, Subsidized, Rate)

FOREIGN KEY(StdNo) REFERENCES Student
FOREIGN KEY(LenderNo) REFERENCES Lender
FOREIGN KEY(InstID) REFERENCES Institution
StdNo NOT NULL
LenderNo NOT NULL
InstID NOT NULL


3. For the ERD in Figure 1, you should indicate applications of the M-N relationship rule. For each M-N relationship rule application, you should list the table name, primary key, and other columns.

There are NONE.

4. For the ERD in Figure 1, you should indicate applications of the identifying relationship rule. For each identifying relationship rule application, you should indicate the changes to the tables you listed in problem 2.


DisburseLine(DateSent, LoanNo, Amount, OrigFee, GuarFee)

FOREIGN KEY(LoanNo) REFERENCES Loan
LoanNo NOT NULL
Its primary key is a combination of DateSent and LoanNo.

5. Convert the ERD shown in Figure 2 into tables.  List the conversion rules used and table design. For each table, you should list the primary key, foreign keys, other columns, and NOT NULL constraints for foreign keys if necessary. You do not need to write CREATE TABLE statements.

The following table conversion uses the Entity Type Rule and the 1-M Rule.

Account(Acctid, AcctName, Balance, Decomposed)

Primary Key: Acctid
FOREIGN KEY(Decomposed) REFERENCES Account
Columns: Attributes listed


6. Convert the ERD shown in Figure 3 into tables.  List the conversion rules used and table design. For each table, you should list the primary key, foreign keys, other columns, and NOT NULL constraints for foreign keys if necessary. You do not need to write CREATE TABLE statements.

The following table conversion uses the Entity Type Rule and the M-N Rule.

Owner(OwnId, OwnName, OwnPhone)

Primary Key: OwnId

Property(PropId, BldgName, UnitNo, Bdrms)

Primary Key: PropId

Shares(PropId, OwnId, StartWeek, EndWeek)

Primary Key: PropId and OwnId
FOREIGN KEY(PropId) REFERENCES Property
FOREIGN KEY(OwnId) REFERENCES Owner
Columns: Attributes listed
